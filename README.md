### Dependencies <a name = "dependencies"></a>

All the following libraries are needed to implement this project:

**Python**<br>
**Pandas**<br>
**Matplotlib**<br>
**Seaborn**<br>
**Flask**<br>
**Keras**<br>
**Pydicom**<br>

It is also highly recommended to use the Anaconda distribution of Python which has most of the data science libraries preinstalled.

### Project Motivation <a name = "motivation"></a>

This project is an effort to utilize all the skills learned in the Springboard's Machine Learning Career Track to solve a real world problem and gain the needed experience to build a large scale AI system and deploy to production.
